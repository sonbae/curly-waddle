# Curly Waddle
I'm going camping soon and I read on Grand Canyon website that the south entrance has a
lot of traffic around 9:30. I want to see on average how bad the traffic is throughout
the week so I can plan my arrival accordingly.

*Why is it called curly waddle?*

I couldn't think of a name and Github suggested this name.

*What could I do better?*

This doesn't do a great job of conveying how bad the traffic is. Maybe I'll come up with
other solutions. To try and improve accuracy, I try changing the brightness, contrast,
and sharpness of the image. I've seen the original image have 21 detections and the
adjusted image have 26 detections.
